# Hipcamp  Recreation

See it deployed here: [Hipcamp Recreation on Netlify](https://meljadyn-recreation.netlify.app/)

This is a recreation of the homepage of Hipcamp made completely from scratch. It features only HTML and CSS with no frameworks, and therefore any elements using JavaScript or other languages are excluded. This is a front-end layout demo, and so I did exclude specific menu and button functionalities, instead just placing and styling the menu buttons.

This recreation features accurate breakpoints for smaller screens, as well as accurate hover states. 

This is a practice to ensure that I am able to make precise and specific decisions regarding the layout of my website.

Please note that this homepage is abridged for time. I added every section that I thought would bring a unique or differing challenge to the table, but no more than that.
