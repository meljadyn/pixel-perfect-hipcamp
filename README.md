# Pixel Perfection
This is a pixel-perfect recreation of the homepage of Hipcamp. It features only HTML and CSS with no frameworks, and therefore any elements using JavaScript or other languages are excluded.

This is a practice to ensure that I am able to make precise and specific decisions regarding the layout of my website. I will have no excuse to modify a design in such a way that the CSS becomes easier for me to write or master.
